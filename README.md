# Important Notice

I do not support or approve video game piracy in any form. If you want to play a game, buy it, to reward the developers of it and to make sure more great games are developed in future.

Video game piracy leads to **stupid, short, advertisement infested** games.

Buy games and use flashcards to play homebrew or copies you made yourself from your own games. Do not use my work with stolen games!
